On November 8th, India’s Prime Minister announced that 86% of the country’s currency would be rendered null and void in 50 days and it will withdraw all
500 and 1,000 rupee notes — the country’s most popular currency denominations from circulation, while a new 2,000 rupee note added in. It was positioned as
a move to crackdown on corruption and the country’s booming under-regulated and virtually untaxed grassroots economy.
