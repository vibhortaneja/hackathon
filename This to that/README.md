# This To That

Often we have played a game where we start with a word and end with another word by changing one letter at a time.

 For example: 
 1. stale->state->slate->plate 
 2. stale->state->spate->slate->plate 

 Program to take the starting and the ending words as input and suggest a shortest sequence to change from start to end. In the example above, the second sequence is valid but longer.
