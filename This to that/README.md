Word chain API in nodejs

Word ladder (also known as Doublets, word-links, change-the-word puzzles, paragrams, laddergrams, or Word golf) is a word game invented by Lewis Carroll. A word ladder puzzle begins with two words, and to solve the puzzle one must find a chain of other words to link the two, in which two adjacent words (that is, words in successive steps) differ by one letter.
